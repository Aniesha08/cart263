<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply <span class="secret">dummy text</span> of the printing and typesetting industry. <span class="redacted">Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</span>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a <span class="secret">type specimen book</span>. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <span class="redacted">typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</span> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with <span class="secret">desktop publishing software</span> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from <span class="redacted">45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</span> Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at <span class="redacted">Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia</span>, looked up one of the more <span class="secret">obscure Latin words</span>, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, <span class="secret">discovered the undoubtable source.</span></p>

<p>It is a long established <span class="redacted">fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page</span> when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal <span class="secret">distribution of letters</span>, as opposed to using <span class="redacted">'Content here, content here'</span>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use <span class="redacted">Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a</span> search for 'lorem ipsum' will <span class="secret">uncover many web sites still in their infancy</span>. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <span class="secret">(injected humour and the like).</span><p>

<p>There are many variations <span class="redacted">of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration</span> in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. <p>
