**The Concept**

InstaEmotion is a project that attempts to shed light on the thoughts and emotions of social media users by revealing aspects of profile owners (commentors) and profile viewers (responders). Sometimes we follow people on social media that we do not necessarily like. We don’t “like” their photos or comment on their photos but we are nosy on what they are up to. We feed our ego based on their success and failures. Or, we follow social media influencers with whom we end up developing feelings of envy and jealousy. InstaEmotion gives the opportunity to explore what possible interactions can occur through comments if the profile viewer got to say how they truly feel. On the other hand, InstaEmotions attempts to also illustrate possibilities of insincerity from the profile owners when they respond to the comments. The third layer of InstaEmotion is followers. As followers seem to play an important role for social media users to validate their acceptance and value, InstaEmotion will test the user’s morals. To get started, I designed an Instagram-like login page and a fake profile for myself. The user will be interacting with the fake profile by clicking through the posts and choosing comments to navigate through the experience. I would not call InstaEmotion a game, but rather an experience.
To create variations between the posts, I tried to make each post represent different domains of social media influencers and creatives. For example, a graphic designer, a poet, a model, a singer, a makeup artist, a traveller and so on. 

**The Interaction & Experience**

Each post has six comments to choose from while each comment is associated with an emotion: 3 positive (compliment, inspiration, encouragement) and 3 negative (disapproval, jealousy and anger). If the participant selects a positive comment, they will get less follower gain per comment compared to the negative comments. Will the profile viewer choose a negative comment just to gain more followers? Or will they stick to their morals and say something nice?

Compliment: + 1 follower

Inspiration: + 3 followers

Encouragement: + 5 followers

Disapproval: + 10 followers

Jealousy: + 20 followers

Anger: + 30 followers

But, here is the twist! There is a hidden condition. Once the participant chooses >= four of any positive comments, they will be rewarded with 100 followers. On the other hand, if the participant chooses >= 5 disapproval comments OR >= 4 jealousy comments OR 3 angry comments, their account will get deactivated!

Each comment has an associated response from the profile owner (me) along with it. The responses have a typing effect to create a live feedback and role exchange effect. Viewing the typing effect creates an impression that you are in the place of the responder. For each post, I have given a voice response to one of the six responses to be found by surprise. Through voice response along with the typing effect, I show the insincerity of the response as I think something else, but respond something else in the comment. In other words, I don’t reveal how I truly feel. When the user chooses the comment that makes fun of my physique in my modelling picture (post 5, comment 4), I give a sarcastic comment, pretending not to be offended while you can hear “the voice in my head” as I type conveying my insecurity of wondering if I really am too skinny. As profile owners, we have negative habits as well such as insecurity, shame, jealousy and so on. We take the likes and comments we receive too personally. We strive for the approval of others. While profile viewers take what they see online and assume it to be the reality. 

**Coding Language & Libraries**

The overall look of the website is all created using HTML5 & CSS3 while JQuery and JQuery UI is used to program the experience. The dialog and progressbar are part of the JQuery UI Library.

**References & Assistance**

To create this project, I referenced W3 Schools website, JQuery and JQuery UI’s API. Any pieces of code taken from online are cited in their respective sections in the comments and well as in the commits. I have recieved assisance from you (Pippin) and also Sabine via email and Zoom meetings. Also mentioned in commits and any section of code that was written by the teacher.
